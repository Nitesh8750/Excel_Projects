# Road Accident Report

This project involves analyzing road accident data to identify patterns, locations with frequent accidents, and the causes behind them. The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving road safety and reducing accidents.

## Project Overview

The **Road Accident Report** project uses data analysis techniques to examine road accidents over time. It includes data cleaning, geospatial analysis of accident locations, and the identification of trends based on accident types, time of day, weather conditions, and more. The insights generated can help city planners, traffic safety organizations, and the public to improve road safety measures.

## Features
- **Accident Frequency Analysis**: Analyzes the number of accidents over time to identify trends and patterns, including peak times for accidents.
- **Location-Based Analysis**: Visualizes accident hotspots on a map to identify high-risk areas.
- **Cause-Based Analysis**: Investigates the causes of accidents (e.g., weather, road conditions, driver behavior).
- **Time-Based Trends**: Examines accidents based on time of day, day of the week, and seasonality.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Prepares the raw data for analysis using Excel functions and tools.

## Dataset
The project uses a road accident dataset containing the following columns:
- `Date`: The date of the accident.
- `Time`: The time of the accident.
- `Location`: The geographical location where the accident occurred.
- `Cause`: The cause of the accident (e.g., driver error, weather conditions).
- `Severity`: The severity of the accident (e.g., minor, major, fatal).
- `Weather`: Weather conditions at the time of the accident.
- `Vehicles Involved`: The number of vehicles involved in the accident.

## Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel**: The analysis is performed using Excel functions, pivot tables, charts, and maps.
- **Excel Pivot Tables & Charts**: For data aggregation and visualization of accident trends.
- **Excel Maps**: To create geospatial visualizations of accident locations.
- **Formulas**: For cleaning data, calculating accident frequencies, and performing cause-based analysis.

## How to Run
1. Download and open the `Road Accident Report.xlsx` file in Microsoft Excel.
2. Enable macros (if prompted) to automate processes like data cleaning and updates.
3. Explore the pivot tables and charts that show the frequency and severity of accidents.
4. Use the map feature to analyze accident hotspots.
5. Review the time-based and cause-based analysis to identify potential factors contributing to accidents.
